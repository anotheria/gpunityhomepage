                                        I run a mining farm in Eastern Quebec, Canada and luckily met Bernhard from MiningOptimizer at a conference in Switzerland where he introduced me to their software.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When I got home I decided to try out MiningOptimizer and so far I am very happy. They were really quick to respond and very professional in handling everything. Onboarding went smoothly and whenever I had a question, it was immediately addressed by either one of their technicians or Bernhard himself.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So far I’m a big fan, there is hardly any downtime for my cards and I was able to up my profit without really any work on my side involved.

                                        I have NVIDIA cards and have been mining for quite some time. I installed MiningOptimzer out of curiosity and am more than satisfied with the outcome. I must say that the guys at MiningOptimizer are fast to reply, easy to talk to and they really are on top of things. Since I have installed the software they have been adding new lucrative coins, which would have completely escaped me. As soon as Grin’s Cuckatoo 31 was launched MiningOptimizer immediately changed the algorithm to the new version and that put a considerable amount of $ into my pockets, as they were one of the first ones to do so.

                                        We have a mining facility in Upstate New York and have been using the MiningOptimizer software pretty much since they were introduced to the market six months ago. What we like must about it is that it really is hassle free.  Mining is automated and new coins and algorithms are added automatically. This really frees up a lot of time. So thumbs up to you guys from MiningOptimizer.

                                        Thank you everybody at MiningOptimizer. I have been using your software for 3 months now and I am very satisfied with its service. The most important feature for me is the reporting. Whenever a coin is mined, I can look at the “comining” feature, which indicates what I would have made mining other coins. This way I can always monitor whether MiningOptimizer is mining the most lucrative coins for me. This is the feature I missed most using whattomine as I was kept in the dark whether the mined coin was really the best one to mine or if another one would have been better.

                    <h3>Bernhard K&uuml;hbeck</h3>
                    <span class="sub-bio-text">VP of Business Development</span>
                    <p>
                        Bernhard is the business developer, product manager and expert in all things usability at GPUnity. He was also born with an unusual combination of a deep curiosity and passion for tech as well as people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bernhard’s entrepreneurial spirit and passion for AI surfaced at the tender age of 24, while still majoring in computer science at the University of Passau, Germany, when he and two fellow students received the EXIST founders stipend from the German government, for tinkering with intelligent motion sensor detectors to be used as safety measures in avalanche accidents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite finding himself at the front of a government backed startup and simultaneously finishing his Masters degree in computer science, he still continued to live out his passion for AI in a Machine Learning project, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025510002392" target="_blank">which he co-published with his professor</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s during this time he realized, he also had a talent for sparking team energy, interpersonal problem-solving and connecting people, skills which make him an outstanding leader and well appreciated colleague.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After several years in start-up mode, he took it up with the big ones and joined Brückner Maschinenbau, and later W&H Dentalwerk, German and Austrian hidden machinery champions.  At both companies he lead international and remote programming teams, managed million dollar budgets and frequently traveled to various parts of the planet such as Latin Amerika, Middle East and China, for product launchings and software deployments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bernhard used the time in the corporate world to hone his skills in leadership, project and product management, UX, intercultural communication and became a Scrum and agile software development guru.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bernhard lives in Salzburg, Austria, which might or might not have something to do with the skiable mountains there.

                    <span class="sub-bio-text">CFO</span>
                    <p>
                        Master of the Finances, Mark Francis is a partner in the San Francisco Bay Area accounting firm Lapidos Leung & Francis, Inc. and has been practicing accounting ever since he graduated from Pennsylvania State, which amounts to a track record of over 20 years.  His practice is diverse but includes a focus on CFO work for tech companies. Mark has made a name for himself in Silicon Valley having overseen companies from formation to mergers and acquisition.  Presently, he serves as CFO for several businesses.  Apart from working his magic as the finance guy, he is also an avid runner, plays in a rock band, loves to cook and is a doting father to his two wonderful daughters. We haven’t yet figured out how he does it all with a smile on his face and time to spare, but we suspect he either got bitten by a radio active spider or he has a twin and they pretend to be one person.
